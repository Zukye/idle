<!--
Description levels in speech.

- the realizer will try the highest priority descriptions first. If it cannot deal with them, it will revert to lower levels.
- all synchronisation points must be present in all levels: if a realizer can ONLY realize the core-BML description, it should still have all synchronisation points available
- note that not all voices can deal with all description levels. In the example below, the text of each level is slightly different, so you can find out which levels are supported by a particular voice
